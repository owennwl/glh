TITLE: Concurrent Analysis (Population Mobility -> Individual Journey Diversity -> PCL5);

! This is one of 9 mediation analyses examining different combinations of:
! 1. Individual mobility metrics (3 options):
!    - journey_diversity
!    - immobility
!    - remoteness
! 2. Mental health symptom measures (3 options):
!    - phq9
!    - gad7
!    - pcl5
!
! Population mobility (gcmr_home_stay) remains the same predictor across all models.
! All 9 analyses follow this same template with different variable combinations.

MODEL:
  journey_diversity ON gcmr_home_stay (a);   ! Path A: Population mobility → Individual mobility
  pcl5 ON journey_diversity (b);             ! Path B: Individual mobility → Mental health symptoms
  pcl5 ON gcmr_home_stay (c_prime);          ! Direct effect: Population mobility → Mental health symptoms

MODEL CONSTRAINT:
